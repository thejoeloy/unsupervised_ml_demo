# unsupervised_ml_demo
Contains a variety of unsupervised machine learning algorithms. Unsupervised algorithms work on unlabled data. These algorithms aim to identify patterns, structure, or relationships within the data. This can help simplify datasets or provide valuable insights.

## Clustering Algorithms
Clustering is a technqiue that is used to group similar datapoints together based on their characteristics or proximity in a dataset.

### K Means Algorithm

### Mean Shift Clustering

### Hierarchal Clustering

## Dimensionality Reduction
Dimensionality reduction is a technique used to simplify and condense complex datasets by transforming them into a lower dimensional space while retaining the most important information.

### PCA

### ICA
